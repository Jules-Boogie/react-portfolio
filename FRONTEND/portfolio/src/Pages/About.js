                    I was raised by my grandparents who emphasized the importance of science and technology
                    in the lives. My grandfather would buy the newest computers and show me how to you them.
                    This was how my love for computers began. My first device was a Samsung SPH A680,
                    I cherished my phone but also used it to take pictures and play video games.

                        I have lived in San Francisco for two years and worked as a Test engineer and
                        IT Engineer. I love living and working in the city. My favorite thing to do is checking out
